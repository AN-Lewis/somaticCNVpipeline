DISCLAIMER
========================================================================================================================
Not all of the code in this repository will work on all systems "out of the box"
  That is because one purpose of this repository is to support continuity within the Jerold Chun lab
  Portions of the code that are most likely to require modification or independent creation include
    Mapping
    Bin location reference
    Segmentation
  There are multiple strategies for each of these actions, and it is beyond the scope of this repo to be universally compatible
This document will aim to indicate which portions of the code are less universal
